## Introduction
In this project, as a data engineer for the STEDI team you build a data lakehouse solution for sensor data that trains a machine learning model.
### Project details
The STEDI Team has been hard at work developing a hardware STEDI Step Trainer that: 
<ul>
<li> trains the user to do a STEDI balance exercise;</li>
<li>and has sensors on the device that collect data to train a machine-learning algorithm to detect steps;</li>
<li>has a companion mobile app that collects customer data and interacts with the device sensors.</li>
</ul>
